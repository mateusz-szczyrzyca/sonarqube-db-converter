## Converter

Sonarqube converter is a simple database converter which was written some 
time ago to quickly convert a really big sonarqube db, which was already in 
PostgreSQL to MySQL format. 
As I know SonarQube offers such tool albeit in enterprise version.

## SonarQube version

This converter was successfully tested on 5.* version hence if you have never 
versions of SonarQube you have to go over your db schema and check what's 
missing or needs to be updates.

## Collaboration

Usually you may have different direction of such conversion but feel free to 
to use it for your own needs. Any updates against newer version of SonarQube 
or fixes highly appreciated!
